      <h2>Why Fight Analytics?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">

        <h3>1. Strike thrown x Strike landed</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h4>1.1 Standing up</h4>
        <p>Strikes landed are all strikes that connect the other fighter and in addition to limb extension, there is a trunk and / or hip movement, characterizing the force of the blow. Non connecting strikes will be considered as thrown strikes. If
          the fighter B is with the arms next to the body, in defense position, while receiving a strike, this strike will be registered as connected strike to fighter A. Kicks that are bad (poorly) defended can be registered as landed strike. Strikes
          missed or clearly avoided by fighter B count only as thrown strikes to fighter A. Strikes only to keep the distance do not count as thrown strikes. Hesitate is not considered a thrown strike.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h4>1.2 In the Clinch</h4>
        <p>When fighters A and B are “ear to ear” and hips together only the side knee strikes (muay thai style) are considered Significant Strike Landed, punches are considered as Strike Thrown. When fighters A and B are “ear to ear” and hips far from
          each other, knees, punches and elbows can be registered as Significant Strike Landed. Shoulder hits will never be registered as strike landed. When athlete A has the back to the fence and B has the double or single leg position and the athlete’s
          B head is below the A’s hip line, punches and elbows thrown by A against B’s head can be registered as strike landed. When athlete A has the back to the fence and B has the double or single leg position and the athlete’s B head is below
          the A’s hip line, only the knees landed by A against B’s hip can be registered as strike landed. Punches and elbows from A against B’s hip are registered as strike thrown.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h4>1.3 Ground ‘n’ Pound</h4>
        <p>When A hits B from the ground and pound position, without having posture, strikes are registered as strike thrown, except for elbows that can be registered as Significant Strike Landed. Strikes thrown from the fighter who has his back on the
          canvas are never Significant Strike Landed, except from elbows in the north south position from inside the full or half-guard, and the upkicks. When A is standing up and B sitting down, A’s kicks against B’s legs may be registered as Significant
          Strike Landed. When B is being dominated by A at turtle position, strikes thrown by A can be registered as Significant Strike Landed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>2. Takedown attempts</h3>
        <p>Fighter A will only have his move registered as a takedown attempt if fighter B has to clearly use force and/or move not to be taken down.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>3. Successful Takedowns</h3>
        <p>Fighter A only will have his move registered as a takedown if fighter B is kept on the ground for more than 3 seconds. The athlete that made the takedown should end the position above the other fighter, if not it will be registered as a takedown
          attempt.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>4. Successful transitions</h3>
        <p>Only offensive transitions count as a transition. Variations of the same position will be not registered as transitions. To count as a successful transition the athlete should maintain the position for at least 3 seconds.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>5. Submission attempts</h3>
        <p>Fighter A will have his move registered as submission attempt if fighter B has to clearly use force and/or move to defend the submission.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>6. Takedown defense</h3>
        <p>Fighter A will only have his maneuver registered as takedown defense if he clearly has to use force or move to defend the takedown by B.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>8. Cage domain</h3>
        <p>Athlete should domain the center of the cage for at least 3 seconds before start counting his center dominating time. If both athletes are in the center no one will get points from it. The athlete has to maintain the opponent against the fence
          for at least 3 seconds to be considered a domain. If A has B against the Cage but his head is below the waistline of B none of them has the domain.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>9. Ground Control</h3>
        <p>
          The athlete has to keep the advantage position for at least 3 seconds before starts counting the ground control time. When A is under B but goes for a submission attempt, the ground control time counting for B is paused until he successfully defends the
          submission attempt.
