<p>Two veterans of the heavyweight UFC will clash on Saturday! However, Roy Nelson and Antonio Silva against the wall, neither can accumulate no more defeat.</p>

<p>Nelson, now 40, won only 2 of his last 8 fights. On the other hand, Silva saw his durability decrease after the ban of TRT (testosterone replacement therapy), losing four fights by knockout in the first round on the last two years. This is a life or death struggle for both athletes.</p>

<p>At 31, Cris Cyborg, is now the most physically imposing fighter in MMA history. Her power is complementary to her exceptional technical moves. 14 wins by knockout in 16 pro fights proves Cyborg efficiency.</p>

<p>Lansberg has a 7 professional MMA fights, however she is a veteran in the Muay Thai world with 80 fights on her record. Still, the Swedish fighter should be no match for Cyborg.</p>
