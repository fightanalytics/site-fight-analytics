        <h3>1. STRIKE THROWN x SIGNIFICANT STRIKE LANDED</h3>

        Strike thrown is any strike that was thrown with an obvious intention of reaching/hurting the opponent.
        All types of strikes are included in this category:
          <h4>1. Strikes that do not land</h4>
          <h4>2. Strikes that land but do not cause damage</h4>
          <h4>3. Strikes that land and cause damage</h4>

        <b>Note 1:</b> Punches to measure distance do not count as strikes thrown &lt;/br&gt;
        <b>Note 2:</b> Hesitating / feinting is not considered as strikes thrown &lt;/br&gt;

        Significant strike landed is any strike that connects on the opposing athlete and also involves either (a+b+c) or (a+b) or (a+c) or (b+c) or (c on its own) from:

        <ol type="a">
          <li>Total extension of the limb used to strike</li>
          <li>Full rotation movement in the hip</li>
          <li>Movement/reaction of the struck opponent.</li>
        </ol>


        <b>Note 1:</b> If athlete Bâ€™s arms are close to his body, in a defensive position, whether standing, in a clinch, on the fence or on the ground, when receiving a blow, this blow can be counted as significant strike landed for athlete A.
        <b>Note 2:</b> Poorly defended and connecting strikes can be counted as Significant Strikes landed.
      </div>

      <div class="text-container col-md-8">
        <h3>2. TAKEDOWN ATTEMPT</h3>

        Athlete A will have his maneuver counted as takedown if she/he

        <ol>
          <li>Clearly exerts force with the intent to take athlete B down</li>
          And/Or
          <li>Move athlete B</li>
        </ol>
      </div>





3. SUCCESSFUL TAKEDOWNS

Athlete A will only have her/his maneuver counted as a takedown if she/he keeps her/his opponentâ€™s hips on the ground for more than 3 (three) seconds.
Athlete A must end up on the top, otherwise it will not be considered a successful takedown, but an attempt.

4. GROUND TRANSITIONS

Only offensive transitions (positional improvement) count as transitions
Variations of the same domain position will not count as a transition.
To count as a successful transition, an athlete must maintain the position for a minimum of 3 (three) seconds.

5. SUBMISSION ATTEMPTS

Athlete A will have her/his maneuver counted as a submission attempt if athlete B obviously has to exert strength and/or maneuver to avoid being submitted.

6. TAKEDOWN DEFENDED

Athlete A will only have her/his maneuver counted as a takedown defense if she/he clearly has to exert force and/or maneuver to avoid being taken down by B.

7. CAGE CONTROL

Athlete A must dominate the center of the cage for at least 3 (three) seconds before starting the time counter.
If both athletes are in the center of the cage, no one will score points.
If A keeps B at the fence, but with her/his head below B's waistline, none of the athletes will be in control.

8. GROUND CONTROL

Athlete A must dominate his opponent's hips on the ground for at least 3 (three) seconds before starting the time counter.
When athlete A is on top position, but athlete B attempts a submission from the bottom, the time will be on hold until A defends the submission.
